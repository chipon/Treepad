# Treepad
Treepad is a graphic software for two-dimension tree simulation, this project may implements two main methods for drawing a tree----iteration method and LS method.  
Declaration:  
The language may be all Chinese, this is because my VS version use Chinese as default  
If possible, I may remake a English project  
But that may take some time, can anyone help me to make this job done? (^_^)  
本工程基于MFC平台VS 2015 Community版本  
This is a project based on MFC project.   
platform: vs 2015 community  
执行文件为debug目录下的Treepad.exe  
You can find the executable file in the debug directory

效果预览图如下：  
The result of the project is as below:

基本操作:  
本软件大部分操作由工具栏完成  
most operation of this software is based on the tool bar  
I initialized the project as a MFC static library  
basic operation:  
首先点击工具栏上的一个树形的图标（提示信息为“画树”），此时进入绘图状态，按住CTRL键不放可以画出垂直的直线  
Firstly click the tree-shape icon on the toolbar, you can see the mouse turn cross-shaped, that mean it gets into draw statu.  
Tips: if you keep the CTRL key down when you draw, the line will be vertical.  
首先是画树干，点击一个点然后拖动可以画出一条线段，软件把第一次画的线段认定为树干，  
Now we draw the trunk, click a point and then move the mouse, you are drawing a line. The first line is recognized as the trunk.  
接着画树枝，每当鼠标位置靠近树干时，鼠标的样式会发生改变，靠近树干时会变成青色的十字，靠近端点会变成红色  
Then we can draw the branches. Move the mouse along the trunk that you drew, you will find the shape of the mouse trun cyan cross,  
or trun red cross when you close to the endpoint of the trunk. On these two status, if you click and then move the mouse as the way  
you draw the trunk, you can finish drawing branches.  
此时如果点击然后拖动完成画树枝的操作。  
点击运行按钮，完成画树的操作。  
After you draw the trunks and branches, you can run the iteration program now. Click the "run" button which is a green rectangle   located in the fifth place of the toolbar. The you will see the result after iteration.  
点击中止按钮，回到运行前的状态。  
Also, you can back to the statu of edit the generator by click the "stop" button to the right of "run" button.  
点击第三个图标（或按CTRL+S），保存当前文件为.tpf格式（为了区分而加上的后缀名）  
Next I will introduce how to keep and open files in the project.   
Click the third icon count form back in the toolbar(or use the shortcut key CTRL+S) to keep the file. I use the extension ".tpf" to   identify the file generated by iteration. which storege the message of generator by the way of serialization of C++.  
点击第二个图标（或按CTRL+O），打开.tpf格式的文件，显示生成元，点击run得到生成的图形   
Click the second icon (or use the shortcut key CTRL+O) , you can open the .tpf file and show its generator. You can run or the edit   the file as the way before.  
点击第四个图标，实现另存为png格式图片的操作  
Click the forth icon counted from back, you can keep the shown picture of current window to .png file.  
点击倒数第三个按钮，选择当前画笔的颜色   
Next I will introduce some extendion function of the software:  
点击指针形状的图标，此时变成不可编辑状态，鼠标形状回到初始状态。  
Click the point-shape icon, now the shape of mouse turn to point shape, which means that you can not edit the generator now.  
I also want to add some function to this statu, like choose a line (either trunk of branch) , move it,edit its length and angle,etc.  
However, this has not been implemented yet, I will mention this at the end of the file.   
点击倒数第二个按钮，重置操作，注意，此操作会清除之前所绘制的图形，回到最初的绘图状态。  
Click the "reset" icon lies in the second icon counted from back, which will erase every modify that you have made to the file.   
I want this operation will be revocable, which is also not implemented by now as well.  
点击最后一个按钮，设置参数，注意，此功能尚未实现，暂时不要点击。   
Click the last button which means "set", here you can change some important parameter to form a tree. But I am very sorry to say that
this function has not been implemented by now, so please don't click it at now. However, I am sure that it will be implemented soon.
本软件的优点：操作简便，可以直接另存为图片  
The advantage of the software is that it is easy in operation, and can keep to picture directly.   
待实现的功能：  
1.设置参数菜单需要实现（调节位置、迭代次数、缩放比例、树干直径及树干直径随迭代次数减小的比例） 
2.实现LS文法绘图：  
预期目标：设置LS编辑的图标或菜单选项，点击后弹出对话框写下初始公理和变换规则，通过设置对话框调节长度、角度、位置，
另存为.lsf文件（作为标识），然后打开文件时选择该文件，可以显示出生成的图形  
（也可以有其他实现方法，这只是我的实现思路）。  
3.可以选择特定区域的图像进行另存为，因为一般有许多空白的部分。
3.实现树枝、树干的选择、剪切、改变长度、改变角度的操作。  
4.实现ctrl+z撤销、ctrl+y前进的功能，每次ctrl+z取消上一次画的一条枝干或主干。
